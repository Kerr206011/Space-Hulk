Space hulk is a Sci-Fi game in the universe of Warhammer 40.000.
One Player takes control of the noble Space Marine Terminators, the most formidiable,
honorable and elite warriors humanity has to offer. The other Player takes control of
the Genstealers, vicious Aliens, dead set on killing all of humanity.

This is a fan project and not for commercial use(GW don't sue me!). I like the idea of
the original board game and want to make it PC compatible.

WOP ofc.
